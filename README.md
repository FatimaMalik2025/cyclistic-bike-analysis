# Bike Share Analysis 

## Project Background
Launched in 2016, Cyclistic is a successful bike-sharing company that has expanded its services and marketing initiatives over the years. While the business is established, there is potential to maximize revenue by increasing the number of members, who are the companyâ€™s primary source of income. Cyclistic collects detailed data on both casual users and members, including their activity patterns on the service.

This project uses Excel to analyze bike-share data with the goal of uncovering the key differences between casual users and members. The insights gained aim to inform strategies that can boost membership adoption and revenue.
